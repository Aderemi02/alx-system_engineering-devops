Explanation
This is a distributed web infrastructure, this has three server and hosts the website www.foobar.com, in this infrastructure there are two major servers, the primary and the replica and the load balancer, this infrastructure has security, it has redundancy in check and also traffic encryption.

Specifics:
Why add firewalls?
This is a security tool used for protecting the network from unauthorized users by acting as a filter between the networks(incoming and outgoing packets) and blocking the server or device which firewall is installed on from cyber-attacks.

Why SSL certificate?
The SSL certificate as the name implies is for securing the data being transferred between the two ends, this helps to encrypt from the sending and decrypt from the recieving end of the communication line. With this you can be assured that the information you recieve has not been tampered with and its directly from the sender. this can be identifed by having the HTTPS or the padlock icon in your address bar. The SSL certs ensure privacy, integrity, and identification are sealed.

Why monitoring clients?
The monitoring clients are for monitoring the servers and the external network. They analyse the performance and operations of the servers, measure the overall health, and alert the administrators if the servers are not performing as expected. The monitoring tool observes the servers and provides key metrics about the servers' operations to the administrators. It automatically tests the accessibility of the servers, measures response time, and alerts for errors such as corrupt/missing files, security vulnerabilities/violations, and many other issues.

BOTTLENECK OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue because the communicationn between the load balancer and the server should not be encrypted, so all SSL is terminated at the load balancer before getting to the server.

Having one MySQL server capable if accepting all write request is an issue because it act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure and also gives problem when the database is down and a write request is sent from the client.

Having servers with all the same components might be a problem because the amount of traffic for the app server or the database might be more than what we have on all the servers combined, having more app servers and or database or any compoment in one makes room for more accommodation of the traffic that particular component will provide, and also if all servers have the same component and the amount of traffic for one component is just about the capacity of the whole component in the entire server, if uograde is to be done on one of the component in one of the servers, it causes downtime as there are no other component of its type in the server to help shed the load on. the load-balancer in this infrastructure as a component also lead to downtime if it is faulty as it is the only channel to the user making it a SPOF.
